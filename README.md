## System Design Decisions

- **Frontend:** Built with Next.js for server-side rendering and easy routing.
- **APIs:** Implemented in the pages/api directory using Next.js API routes.
- **SEO Optimization:** Utilized the 'next/head' component for setting up meta tags, titles, and structured data.
- **Styling:** Used CSS or MeterialUI for UI styling.
- **Repository Structure:** Organized code into pages, components, and API folders for maintainability.
